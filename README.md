Nothing really special here, but I wanted to have these synced between my computers and decided to make the repo public. Use the code as you want, no credit to me needed.

### xtox
A base-to-base converter written in C. It supports any base from 2 to 36, because of limitations from strtol. It converts from entered base to wanted base at once. Supports both arguments and interactive/stdin, result is written to stdout.

### base64
A base 64 decoder. It uses [libb64](http://libb64.sourceforge.net/) for decoding and the input parser is written by me. The C files provided by libb64 needs to be downloaded from their website and included in the files. Supports both arguments and interactive/stdin, result is written to stdout.
